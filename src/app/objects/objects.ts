export const FAQ_ELEMENTS: any[] = [
  {
    index: 1,
    question: 'What is an NPN?',
    answer: 'NPN stands for Natural Product Number. In Canada, dietary supplements are termed “Natural Health Products”. The NPN is an unique number assigned to your Natural Health Product, regulated under Health Canada, and is required for any product to be sold in Canada, and would require complete issuance of a NPN prior to manufacturing and commencement of marketing and sales activities and/or importation.'
  },
  {
    index: 2,
    question: 'Application Overview',
    answer: 'NPN applications are increasingly complex with the regulatory framework Health Canada is imposing as part of its mandate to regulate dietary supplements. In order to obtain a NPN for your product, Health Canada requires evidence to support your product’s safety, efficacy and quality. Some examples of information required in order to fulfil this requirement are as follows:' +
      '<ul>' +
      '<li>Product Name</li>' +
      '<li>Company under which the product is to be marketed under</li>' +
      '<li>Manufacturer/Importer for the product and their Site Licence number</li>' +
      '<li>Potency, Quantity of each medicinal ingredient (including solvents, herbal constituents and extraction ratios for herbal ingredients)</li>' +
      '<li>Non-medicinal ingredients</li>' +
      '<li>Delivery/dosage format</li>' +
      '<li>Desired claims</li>' +
      '<li>Proposed cautionary statements</li>' +
      '</ul>' +
      'Subsequent to establishing these details, documentation will need to be submitted to Health Canada, including the Product Licence Application form, Finished Product Specification, and more.\n'
  },
  {
    index: 3,
    question: 'The Synapse Process (formerly named Our Process)',
    answer: 'SynapseNHP guides you through a tailored but efficient process in order to successfully secure your NPN. The bulk of the work is in the front end, and Synapse will see the process through for you.' +
      '<ol>' +
      '<li><b>NDA signing</b>: we recognize the importance of Intellectual Property and the immense effort our clients put in to designing specialty formulations. All communications remain strictly confidential, and are released only to parties necessary in obtaining the NPN (i.e. Health Canada, designated manufacturers, designated third party labs as deemed necessary by confirmation by you, the client).</li><br/>' +
      '<li><b>Formulation assessment</b>: we will review your formulation and confirm viability of NPN approval, thereby providing an official quotation for the application. Synapse provides a guarantee for NPN approvals, with a 90% refund policy for unsuccessful applications. As such, we do not take on projects where formulations are flagged in cases where certain ingredients cannot be approved. At this stage, we will establish full formulation details in order to generate a Finished Product Specification, along with providing expert guidance on what claims can be made. This is the stage at which the heaviest lifting is done. Unlike other consulting companies, SynapseNHP has a background in manufacturing of Natural Health Products, and has a key edge when it comes to establishing sound formulations and Finished Product Specifications.</li><br/>' +
      '<li><b>Dossier Preparation</b>: We will generate the full application dossier and provide the Product Licence Application (PLA) draft for your review and confirmation. At this stage, a proposed label text will be provided to you to begin design work, allowing for more efficient use of time.</li><br/>' +
      '<li><b>Submission Management</b>: SynapseNHP will submit the dossier to Health Canada on your behalf and manage the submission until approval.</li><br/>' +
      '<li><b>Label & Packaging Review</b>: Upon completion, we will provide a finalised label text, which you can use to update and complete design work on all packaging materials, along with confirming specifications with your manufacturer, and you’re on your way to product launch!</li><br/>' +
      '</ol>'
  },
  {
    index: 4,
    question: 'Why do I need SynapseNHP for NPN applications?',
    answer: 'Unlike the US and various other countries, Health Canada has strict regulations requiring product registrations and assessments for what products can be sold on the market, entailing full compliance review of each individual product. The framework for this can be tricky, and require careful navigation of the complexities of the NHP regulations. We can help you streamline the process, avoiding delays in bureaucratic processing, and increase your chance for success.'
  },
  {
    index: 5,
    question: 'What testing is required for my NHP?',
    answer: 'This will depend on your product; SynapseNHP’s process covers guidance on what testing requirements are most optimal for ensuring safety and efficacy for your consumers, whilst managing associated testing costs from a business consideration standpoint.'
  },
  {
    index: 6,
    question: 'Do I need a licence when selling natural health products through Amazon Canada?',
    answer: 'Yes, all NHPs marketed and sold in Canada, regardless of the channel in which the product is sold requires compliance to Health Canada’s regulations. Amazon specifically has a Product Compliance team which regularly reviews and audits products sold on its platform.'
  },
  {
    index: 7,
    question: 'How long will I need to wait for my NPN to be approved?',
    answer: 'SynapseNHP will provide you guidance on estimated application times in the “Formulation Assessment” phase of our process. Service standards for Health Canada are updated periodically, and range between 60 calendar days to 210 calendar days (from acknowledgement of dossier receiving).'
  },
  {
    index: 8,
    question: 'How much will it cost to get my NPN through SynapseNHP?',
    answer: 'SynapseNHP’s fees for NPN application are tailored for each application. Due to the inherent formulation differences and regulatory navigation required to assess formulations and deliver to you the most optimal NPN licence, we find this tailored approach to be most suitable.<br/><br/>' +
      'Additionally, we are currently in a transitional phase with a proposed bill to implement cost recovery for Health Canada’s Natural Health Product, wherein Health Canada is looking to implement various registration fees for NPN applications, which can range from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars, increasing every year for 7 years. As part of SynapseNHP’s mission to help our customers provide quality Natural Health Products to the market to improve health outcomes for your customers, we are supporting various agencies who are at the forefront of fighting cost recovery in order to keep costs manageable for brand owners such as yourself.'

        text: 'One of the misconceptions about starting a blog is that you need to be a great writer to be successful. Nothing could be further from the truth. People read blog sites to get a personal perspective on things, so most bloggers write in a very informal and conversational style.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'And because of the format, many successful bloggers will write about a variety of topics on the same blog.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'In addition, you don’t need to be an expert on any of the topics you write about to have a successful blog. For example, visitors to a cooking blog don’t want to read a textbook from a food scientist, they want to hear the experiences of someone who has actually cooked some real meals, mistakes and all.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'To be successful as a blogger there is really just one requirement: a passion for your topic.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Writing about things that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your visitors interested.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Share your story. A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.\n' +
          'Make money from home. Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a piece of content and then continue to profit from it long after the the writing is finished. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.\n' +
          'Recognition for yourself or your business. No, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.\n' +
          'Find a community. Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post and people comment on it. This is a good way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.\n' +

          '\n' +
          'Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a “comments” section where visitors can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your visitors in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.\n' +

        text: 'If you don’t have an idea for a name already, the first step is choosing your blog topic.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'If you’re not sure what to blog about, there are a few ways to find a good blog topic:\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Life experiences. Everyone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations.\n' +
          'For example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman’s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.\n' +
          'Think about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).\n' +
          'A personal blog. A personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share your thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.\n' +
          'Hobbies & passions. Hobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about hobbies with smaller audiences can be successful, as you are able to tap into a global audience with your blog.\n' +
          'Once you have a topic it’s time to choose your blog name, also known as your domain name.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'A good blog name should be descriptive so that potential visitors can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'If you are blogging about one specific topic then you will definitely want to include that in some way when you pick a domain name. Try not to get hung-up on just one word though. For example, a cooking blog doesn’t necessarily have to have the word “cooking” in it. The words “food”, “recipes”, and “meals” would also let people know that your blog is about cooking.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'If you are planning to create a personal blog where you discuss a variety of topics then I recommend using your name, or some variation of it, since your blog is all about you. For example, I own the blog scottchow.com. You can also add your middle name or middle initial if you find your name is already taken. Or you could use a variation like “Scott Chow Blog” or “Blogging with Scott”.\n' +

          'Can’t decide on a good name for your blog? Contact me and I will help you personally (for free)!\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Once you have some name ideas you will need to choose a domain extension.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'A .com domain extension is the most preferred, but .net, .org, .co, or other extension work just as well. It is also important to note that for the purposes of a blog domain you cannot have any spaces between words. So “Blogging with Scott” becomes bloggingwithscott.com'

          'At its heart, blogging is about sharing your knowledge with the world. Writing about things that you are passionate about makes the process of starting a successful blog so much easier. As long as you are writing about things that you are genuinely interested in, your passion will shine through and keep your visitors interested.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'So why would you go to the trouble of blogging? There are a few reasons:\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Share your story. A blog allows you to have a voice and be heard. You can share your story with the entire world if you so choose. One of the most common ways blogs are used are as a diary where the blogger writes about their daily experiences so that friends, family, and others can all be a part of their lives.\n' +
          'Make money from home. Blogging can be quite lucrative if done correctly. The top bloggers in the world obviously earn quite a bit, but even a part-time blogger can expect to make a nice profit if things are done correctly. The best part about it is that blogging is a form of passive income, since you can spend just a few hours a week writing a piece of content and then continue to profit from it long after the the writing is finished. I go into much more detail on how to blog for money later in this guide.\n' +
          'Recognition for yourself or your business. No, you probably won’t have paparazzi following you around because of your latest post. But a successful blog makes your idea into a reality, and can gain you a ton of recognition in your respective field. Many bloggers are known as experts just because of their blogs, and some have even gotten book and movie deals based on their blogs.\n' +
          'Find a community. Blogging at its heart is interactive. You write a post and people comment on it. This is a good way to connect with people who are interested in the same things as you are. Blogging allows you to teach these people based on your experience, and it gives you the opportunity to learn from your readers as well.\n' +

          'Bloggers often write from a personal perspective that allows them to connect directly with their readers. In addition, most blogs also have a “comments” section where visitors can correspond with the blogger. Interacting with your visitors in the comments section helps to further the connection between the blogger and the reader.\n' +

          '\n' +
          'If you’re not sure what to blog about, there are a few ways to find a good blog topic:\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Life experiences. Everyone has lessons they have learned through life experience. Sharing this knowledge can be incredibly helpful to others in similar situations.\n' +
          'For example, I recently helped a woman start her blog about being a fireman’s wife. She has a lot of experience and knowledge to share with others about this topic, and it has helped her connect with others in similar situations.\n' +
          'Think about the things you have experienced in life. This could be related to your family (example: a blog about being a stay at home mom), work (a blog about experiences dealing with clients), or other life experiences (a blog about dealing with a troubling time such as a disease or divorce, or about a happy time such as preparing for a wedding or a birth of a child).\n' +
          'A personal blog. A personal blog is a blog all about you. This will include a variety of topics, from things you do on a daily basis, to random thoughts and musings. This is a great way to share your thoughts with the world without having to stick to just one topic.\n' +
          'Hobbies & passions. Hobbies or other interests you are passionate about are a great place to start. Cooking, travel, fashion, sports, and cars are all classic examples. But even blogs about hobbies with smaller audiences can be successful, as you are able to tap into a global audience with your blog.\n' +
          'Once you have a topic it’s time to choose your blog name, also known as your domain name.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'A good blog name should be descriptive so that potential visitors can instantly tell what your blog is about just from the name.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'If you are blogging about one specific topic then you will definitely want to include that in some way when you pick a domain name. Try not to get hung-up on just one word though. For example, a cooking blog doesn’t necessarily have to have the word “cooking” in it. The words “food”, “recipes”, and “meals” would also let people know that your blog is about cooking.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'If you are planning to create a personal blog where you discuss a variety of topics then I recommend using your name, or some variation of it, since your blog is all about you. For example, I own the blog scottchow.com. You can also add your middle name or middle initial if you find your name is already taken. Or you could use a variation like “Scott Chow Blog” or “Blogging with Scott”.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Can’t decide on a good name for your blog? Contact me and I will help you personally (for free)!\n' +
          '\n' +
          'Once you have some name ideas you will need to choose a domain extension.\n' +
          '\n' +
          'A .com domain extension is the most preferred, but .net, .org, .co, or other extension work just as well. It is also important to note that for the purposes of a blog domain you cannot have any spaces between words. So “Blogging with Scott” becomes bloggingwithscott.com'
